# Files 

```
# Robots.txt 

This file is to prevent the crawling and indexing of certain parts of your site by web crawlers and spiders run by sites like Yahoo and Google. By telling these "robots" where not to go on your site, you save bandwidth and server resources.
```

```
# package.json 

This file holds various metadata relevant to the project. This file is used to give information to npm that allows it to identify the project as well as handle the project's dependencies.

Use npm install, it will install all the dependencies
```

```

```
# package-lock.json

If youâ€™re using npm ^5.x.x, by default a package-lock.json will be generated for you.
You SHOULD commit your package-lock to source control

It stores an exact, versioned dependency tree rather than using starred versioning like package.json itself (e.g. 1.0.*). This means you can guarantee the dependencies for other developers or prod releases, etc. It also has a mechanism to lock the tree but generally will regenerate if package.json/node_modules changes or if we run npm install 

Describe a single representation of a dependency tree such that teammates, deployments, and continuous integration are guaranteed to install exactly the same dependencies.

Provide a facility for users to "time-travel" to previous states of node_modules without having to commit the directory itself.
To facilitate greater visibility of tree changes through readable source control diffs.
